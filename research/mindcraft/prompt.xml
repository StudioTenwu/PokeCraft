https://github.com/mindcraft-bots/mindcraft/blob/stable/minecollab.md has information about the minecollab benchmark.

I personally find the minecollab benchmark really interesting because it situates multi-agent collaboration and the difficulties there into such a familiar environment. Mindcraft is also such a nice environment to let a person see how their ways of customizing the agent has really payed off.

Your task is really simple. I want a way to easily deploy a set of agents into Minecraft and for the user to be able to inspect their behaviors in the collaborative settings of Minecollab. 

I am not exactly sure what this will look like, so the world is your oyster!

You should first explore MineCollab. First deploy MineCollab by itself. And then try to deploy custom agents. Build a small interface on top of the mindcraft repository to make it easy to customize these agents.
