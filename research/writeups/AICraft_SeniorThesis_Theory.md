<SeniorThesisInfo>
A senior thesis is more than a big project write-up. It is documentation of an attempt to contribute to the general understanding of some problem of computer science, together with exposition that sets the work in the context of what has come before and what might follow. In computer science, some theses involve building systems, some involve experiments and measurements, some are theoretical, some involve human subjects, and some do more than one of these things. Some theses prove their hypotheses, and some report that extensive investigations into their hypotheses supported only the null hypothesis. Computer science is unusual among scientific disciplines in that current faculty research has many loose ends appropriate for undergraduate research.

Senior thesis projects generally emerge from collaboration with faculty. Students looking for senior thesis projects should tell professors they know, especially professors whose courses they are taking or have taken, that they are looking for things to work on. See the page on CS Research for Undergrads. Ideas often emerge from recent papers discussed in advanced courses. The terms in which some published research was undertaken might be generalized, relaxed, restricted, or applied in a different domain to see if changed assumptions result in a changed solution. Once a project gets going, it often seems to assume a life of its own.

Thesis Supervisor
You need a thesis supervisor. Normally this is a Harvard Computer Science faculty member. Joint concentrators (and, in some cases, non-joint concentrators) might have a FAS/SEAS Faculty member from a different field as their thesis supervisor. Exceptions to the requirement that the thesis supervisor is a CS or FAS/SEAS faculty member must be approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies. For students whose advisor is not a Harvard CS faculty member, note that at least one of your thesis readers must be a Harvard CS faculty member, and we encourage you to talk with this faculty member regularly to help ensure that your thesis is appropriately relevant for Harvard Computer Science.
  <ThesisSupervisor>
  Note that my Thesis Supervisor will be Prof. Elena Glassman. This is her website: https://glassmanlab.seas.harvard.edu/glassman.html. This is the information about her lab: https://glassmanlab.seas.harvard.edu/. This is her research statement for the lab:

    <ResearchStatement>
  AI is powerful, but it can make objective errors, generate contextually inappropriate outputs, and offer disliked options. We defined and build AI-resilient interfaces that help people use AI while being resilient to AI choices that are not right, or not right for them. This is critical during context- and preference-dominated open-ended tasks, like ideating, searching, sensemaking, and reading or writing text and code at scale. AI-resilient interfaces improve AI safety, usability, and utility by working with, not against, human perception, attention, and cognition. To achieve this, we derive design implications from cognitive science, even when they fly in the face of common usability guidelines.

  </ThesisSupervisor>

It’s up to you and your supervisor how frequently you meet and how engaged the supervisor is in your thesis research. However, we encourage you to meet with your supervisor at least several times during the Fall and Spring, and to agree on deadlines for initial results, chapter outlines, drafts, etc.

Students will need to submit a thesis advisor contract.

<SeniorThesisFormat>
The thesis should contain an informative abstract separate from the body of the thesis. This abstract should clearly state what the contribution of the thesis is–which parts are expository, whether there are novel results, etc. We also recommend the thesis contain an introduction that is at most 5 pages in length that contains an “Our contributions” section which explains exactly what the thesis contributed, and which sections in the thesis these are elaborated on.
At the degree meeting, the Committee on Undergraduate Studies in Computer Science will review the thesis abstract, the reports from the readers and the student’s academic record; it will have access to the thesis. The readers (and student) are told to assume that the Committee consists of technical professionals who are not necessarily conversant with the subject matter of the thesis so their reports (and abstract) should reflect this audience.

The length of the thesis should be as long as it needs to be to present its arguments, but no longer! There is no minimum or maximum page length; 10 pages or less could be appropriate if they’re mostly dense math proofs some of which are novel, and 100 pages or more could be appropriate if they contain mostly large figures and/or English discussion.

# Senior Thesis Plan

## Context

My senior thesis will be on using AI advancements to create Educational Tools. Some of my most recent concrete product thinking is in [AICraft](AICraft.md).

The primary theoretical grounding of what I want to do is the theory of "microworlds". Microworlds is a theory popularized by Seymour Papert in his book Mindstorms, and is drawn on both Piagetian cognitivist learning theory. Specifically, I believe that microworlds are important as environments under which learners appropriate concepts as their own to get at important understand of emergent behaviors of acting under systems of rules. The general skill of acting under different systems of rules is important enough. But also by allowing the student to act under systems of rules that greater and greater approximate reality, we can help facilitate their cognitive development. This theory is grounded in Piaget's idea that children go through stages of epistemological development. Due to this, facts cannot be "assimilated" into the child's cognitive schema if the child do not already possess the requisite structures for those facts. This is furthe related to Vygotsky's idea of "Zone of Proximal Development". In the "Zone of Proximal Development", children use "Play" as a way to facilitate their development. This play is different from symbols. It is a substitution that help one get at critical aspects of abstraction.

We use practice worlds, generative worlds, compared to real world to help the learner engage through play a deeper understanding of what they are thinking.

Quotes:

Mind in Society, page 85, Interaction between Learning and Development

"A well known and empirically established fact is that learning
should be matched in some manner with the child's developmental level.
For example, it has been established that the teaching of reading, writ-
ing, and arithmetic should be initiated at a specific age level. Only
recently, however, has attention been directed to the fact that we cannot
limit ourselves merely to determining developmental levels if we wish to
discover the actual relations of the developmental process to learning
capabilities. We must determine at least two developmental levels.
The first level can be called the actual developmental level, that is,
the level of development of a child's mental functions that has been
established as a result of certain already completed developmental
cycles. When we determine a child's mental age by using tests, we are
almost always dealing with the actual developmental level. In studies
of children's mental development it is generally assumed that only those
things that children can do on their own are indicative of mental abilities.
We give children a battery of tests or a variety of tasks of varying
degrees of difficulty, and we judge the extent of their mental develop-
ment on the basis of how they solve them and at what level of difficulty.
On the other hand, if we offer leading questions or show how the problem
is to be solved and the child then solves it, or if the teacher initiates
the solution and the child completes it or solves it in collaboration with
other children-in short, if the child barely misses an independent
solution of the problem-the solution is not regarded as indicative of his
mental development. This "truth" was familiar and reinforced by com-
mon sense. Over a decade even the profoundest thinkers never ques-
tioned the assumption; they never entertained the notion that what
children can do with the assistance of others might be in some sense
even more indicative of their mental development than what they can
do alone."

Seymour Papert, "Mindstorms", Chapter 5:

But I wish to argue
for a different philosophy of physics education. It is my belief that learning
physics consists of bringing physics knowledge into contact with very
diverse personal knowledge. And to do this we should allow the learner to
construct and work with transitional systems that the physicist may refuse
to recognize as physics.


Person

Agent.

Agent has skills. 

These skills you can author. They can encounter dynamically. 

The skills are properties of the agent. 

As you enter different microwords that are for different possibilities, those would spur you to describe different skills.

  The Core Parallel

  Both Winnicott and Vygotsky are describing mediation - how humans develop psychological sophistication through
  intermediate objects/tools:

  Winnicott's Transitional Objects:

  - The progression: Mother → Transitional Object (blanket/toy) → Independent self
  - The "space between": Transitional objects occupy the psychological space between subjective ("me") and
  objective ("not-me") reality
  - The function: They enable the child to manage the anxiety of separation while developing a more sophisticated
   understanding that they and mother are separate beings
  - The endpoint: Child no longer needs the object - they've internalized the psychological capacity to manage
  separation and engage with objective reality

  Vygotsky's Mediation:

  - The progression: External tools/signs → Guided use (ZPD) → Internalized psychological functions
  - Tools and signs: Physical tools and symbolic signs (especially language) mediate between the individual and
  the world
  - The function: They enable higher psychological functions - language allows us to think about thinking, plan,
  regulate behavior
  - The endpoint: External mediation becomes internal - we don't need the external tool anymore because we've
  internalized the capability

  The Deep Connection

  One of the search results explicitly connects them ("The concept of sign in the work of Vygotsky, Winnicott,
  and Bakhtin" and "Transitionality, Playing, Identification and Symbolization: Winnicott and Vygotsky"):

  Both describe a three-stage developmental arc:

  1. Fusion/Dependence: Complete reliance on another (mother/more knowledgeable other)
  2. Transitional mediation: An intermediate object/tool that bridges internal and external worlds
  3. Internalization/Independence: The external mediator is no longer needed - its function has been internalized

  The key insight: Transitional objects ARE mediating tools in Vygotsky's sense! They mediate the psychological
  transition from fusion to separation, from subjective to objective reality.

  Why This Matters for AICraft

  This theoretical framework provides powerful justification for your design:

  The AI Agent as Transitional Object:
  - Children form attachment to their agent (like Winnicott's blanket)
  - The agent mediates between the child's desires/creativity and technical reality
  - Through nurturing the agent, children learn about:
    - Their own cognitive processes (memory, perception, reasoning)
    - How to break down complex tasks (tool composition)
    - How to communicate and collaborate (multi-agent systems)

  The progression you're designing:
  1. Initial dependence: Child configures basic agent, depends on it as pokemon/helper
  2. Active mediation: Child uses "empathizer role" to understand agent's perspective - this IS the transitional
  space where learning happens
  3. Internalization: Child internalizes principles of agent design and can apply them without needing the
  specific agent anymore

  The "Empathizer Role" is crucial - it's the transitional space where:
  - Child experiences what agent "knows" and "perceives" (Winnicott's potential space)
  - Child learns to think about thinking (Vygotsky's higher psychological functions)
  - The agent becomes a "tool-to-think-with" (Papert, building on both traditions)

  The Microworld Connection

  Papert's microworlds explicitly build on both traditions:
  - Winnicott: Microworlds provide "transitional space" for exploration and play
  - Vygotsky: They provide structured environments where tools mediate learning

  Your primitives (Perception, Memory, Tools, Communication) are Vygotskian cultural tools that:
  - Can be explored at the child's own pace (low floor)
  - Provide infinite sophistication (high ceiling)
  - Mediate between concrete experience and abstract principles
  - Eventually become internalized ways of thinking

  The "Export" Feature is Key

  When children export their agents to real-world tasks, they're completing the transitional arc:
  - Agent starts as "transitional object" in safe microworld
  - Gradually becomes internalized understanding
  - Export demonstrates that learning has transferred - child can deploy these ideas beyond the original context

  This is exactly what Winnicott describes: the transitional object enables the child to engage with objective
  reality independently.

  ---
  Synthesis: Your AICraft design intuitively captures deep developmental psychology. The AI agents function as
  both Winnicottian transitional objects (safe, attachable pokemons that enable psychological growth) AND
  Vygotskian mediating tools (cultural instruments that scaffold learning in the ZPD). The "empathizer role"
  creates the crucial transitional/mediational space where transformation happens.
