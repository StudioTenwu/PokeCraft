## What We Found

### Research Areas Explored
1. ✅ **Constructionism & Microworlds** - 5 papers (Papert, Kahn & Winters, Noss & Hoyles, etc.)
2. ✅ **Learning Through Play** - 5 papers (Zosh et al., Parker et al., Colliver & Fleer, etc.)
3. ✅ **AI Agents in Education** - 5 papers (Lin et al., Yang et al., Bai et al., etc.)

### Key Findings

**🎯 AICraft fills a research gap**: No existing platform combines agent engineering + constructionist microworlds + playful nurturing + real-world deployment

**📊 Strong evidence for our approach**:
- Constructionism + AI validated (Kahn & Winters 2021, 130 citations)
- Play-based learning effective (Zosh et al. 2017, 501 citations)
- Children can work with AI agents (Lin et al. 2020, 207 citations)
- Pokemon metaphor supported (Pérez-Marín et al. 2020, 229 citations)

**🔬 Research opportunities**: AICraft can generate new research on children's mental models of AI agents
