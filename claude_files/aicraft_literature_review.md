## Research Synthesis for AICraft

### Core Theoretical Support
1. **Constructionism** (Kahn & Winters 2021, Noss & Hoyles 2017) supports agent-building as learning
2. **Play-based learning** (Zosh et al. 2017, Parker et al. 2022) validates learning through playful exploration
3. **Self-Determination Theory** (Deci & Ryan 2012) explains why relevance and autonomy matter
4. **Computational thinking** (Bers 2020) supports teaching programming concepts through play

### Design Validation
- **Minecraft studies** show game environments can support deep learning
- **AI agent research** (Lin et al. 2020, Yang et al. 2025) demonstrates children can work with AI agents
- **Metaphor-based learning** (Pérez-Marín et al. 2020) supports Pokemon/agent-raising metaphor

### Gap AICraft Fills
Current research covers:
- ✅ AI agents in education (mostly as tutors)
- ✅ Game-based learning (mostly content delivery)
- ✅ Computational thinking (mostly coding)

**Missing**: Platform where children **engineer AI agents themselves** through playful exploration of composable primitives (Perception, Memory, Tools, Communication) in a microworld

AICraft uniquely combines:
1. Agent engineering (not just using agents)
2. Constructionist microworld design
3. Exportable artifacts (real-world deployment)
4. Pokemon-style nurturing metaphor
