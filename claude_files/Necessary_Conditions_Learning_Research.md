# Necessary Conditions of Learning - Research Compilation

## Book Information

**Title:** Necessary Conditions of Learning
**Author:** Ference Marton
**Publisher:** Routledge (Taylor & Francis)
**Year:** 2015 (available 2014)
**Pages:** 324
**ISBN:** 978-0-415-73914-6 (paperback)

### About the Author

**Ference Marton** is Professor of Education at Göteborg University, Sweden and Honorary Professor at the Faculty of Education, The University of Hong Kong. He is internationally recognized for:

- Introducing the distinction between **deep and surface approaches to learning** (with Roger Säljö, 1976)
- Developing **phenomenography** as a methodology for educational research (1970s-1980s)
- Creating the **variation theory of learning** (1990s-2000s)

### Book Overview

The book presents:
1. **Phenomenography** - A research approach for studying how people experience and understand phenomena
2. **Variation Theory of Learning** - A theory explaining how learning occurs through discernment of patterns of variation
3. **Practical Applications** - Evidence-based pedagogical applications in educational contexts

### Core Thesis

**Main Argument:** In order to learn, we must **discern**, and to discern the intended ideas we must be presented with **carefully structured variation** against a background of **invariance**. Learning involves processes of:
- **Contrast** - Distinguishing differences
- **Generalization** - Identifying patterns
- **Fusion** - Integrating understanding

### Research Foundation

The book draws on **hundreds of empirical studies** conducted in Europe and Asia, building on the variation theory framework developed over four decades of research.

## Seminal Papers & Key Works

### 1. Deep and Surface Learning (1976) - THE FOUNDATION

**Marton, F. & Säljö, R. (1976a).** "On qualitative differences in learning: I—Outcome and process."
*British Journal of Educational Psychology*, 46, 4–11.
DOI: 10.1111/j.2044-8279.1976.tb02980.x

**Marton, F. & Säljö, R. (1976b).** "On qualitative differences in learning: II—Outcome as a function of the learner's conception of the task."
*British Journal of Educational Psychology*, 46, 115–127.
DOI: 10.1111/j.2044-8279.1976.tb02304.x

**Significance:** These two papers are the **foundational seminal works** that introduced the concepts of deep and surface approaches to learning. The research at University of Gothenburg showed that students approach learning with different intentions:
- **Deep approach:** Intention to understand meaning, relate to prior knowledge, structure ideas, critically evaluate
- **Surface approach:** Intention to reproduce text, memorize through rote learning

**Impact:** This distinction revolutionized understanding of student learning and became one of the most cited concepts in higher education research.

### 2. Phenomenography Papers (1970s-1981)

**Marton, F. (1975).** "On Non-Verbatim Learning: II. The Erosion Effect of a Task Induced Learning Algorithm."
*Reports from the Institute of Education, University of Göteborg*, No. 40

**Marton, F., Dahlgren, L.O., Svensson, L., & Säljö, R. (1977).** "Inlärning och omvärldsuppfattning" [Learning and the conception of the world around us].
Stockholm: Almqvist & Wiksell. (Later translated and republished in 2016)

**Marton, F. (1981).** "Phenomenography—Describing conceptions of the world around us."
*Instructional Science*, 10, 177–200.
DOI: 10.1007/BF00132516

**Significance:** The 1981 paper is the **defining paper of phenomenography** as a research methodology. Phenomenography focuses on:
- Qualitatively different ways people experience phenomena
- Content-oriented and interpretative descriptions
- Second-order perspective (how people experience, not what exists)
- Collective level of analysis (categories of description)

### 3. Learning and Awareness (1997) - MAJOR THEORETICAL WORK

**Marton, F. & Booth, S. (1997).** *Learning and Awareness.*
Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. (Educational Psychology Series)

**Significance:** This book synthesized **two decades of phenomenographic research** (1970s-1990s) into a comprehensive theoretical model. It laid the groundwork for variation theory by:
- Synthesizing empirical findings from phenomenographic studies
- Developing a model of learning and awareness
- Bridging phenomenography and theory of learning
- Introducing concepts of discernment and variation

**Status:** This is the **bridge work** between phenomenography (research methodology) and variation theory (learning theory).

### 4. Variation Theory Development (2000s)

**Marton, F. & Tsui, A.B.M. (Eds.). (2004).** *Classroom Discourse and the Space of Learning.*
Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.

**Significance:** This book documented the development of **learning study** methodology in Hong Kong (2000-2003) and formalized variation theory principles for classroom practice.

**Marton, F. (2015).** *Necessary Conditions of Learning.*
New York: Routledge.

**Significance:** The culmination of 40+ years of research, presenting the **mature formulation of variation theory** with comprehensive empirical evidence and practical applications.

### 5. Related Influential Works

**Biggs, J.B. & Collis, K.F. (1982).** *Evaluating the Quality of Learning: The SOLO Taxonomy.*
New York: Academic Press.

**Significance:** Complementary framework to Marton's work, providing the **Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO)** taxonomy for assessing learning quality.

**Entwistle, N. & Ramsden, P. (1983).** *Understanding Student Learning.*
London: Croom Helm.

**Significance:** Extended Marton and Säljö's work on approaches to learning, adding the **strategic approach** and developing practical applications for higher education.

## Key Concepts and Theoretical Framework

### Phenomenography

**Definition:** A qualitative research methodology for investigating the qualitatively different ways people experience, conceptualize, perceive, and understand phenomena.

**Key Principles:**
- Focus on variation in human experience
- Second-order perspective (how people see, not what is)
- Collective analysis (categories of description)
- Context-dependent understanding
- Non-dualistic ontology (internal/external are inseparable)

**Research Process:**
1. Select phenomenon of interest
2. Collect data (typically interviews)
3. Identify variation in experiences
4. Develop categories of description
5. Create outcome space (logical relationships)

### Variation Theory of Learning

**Core Principle:** Learning occurs through **discernment** of critical aspects of phenomena, which requires experiencing **patterns of variation**.

**Four Patterns of Variation:**
1. **Contrast** - Experience differences to discern a feature
2. **Separation** - Vary one aspect while keeping others constant
3. **Generalization** - Experience variation to see what varies and what stays invariant
4. **Fusion** - Experience simultaneous variation of critical aspects

**Critical Aspects:** The features of a phenomenon that must be discerned for intended learning to occur. These are not inherent in the content but emerge from the relationship between learner and phenomenon.

**Object of Learning:**
- **Intended** - What teachers plan students should learn
- **Enacted** - What is made possible to learn in teaching
- **Lived** - What students actually learn

### Deep vs. Surface Learning

**Deep Approach:**
- Intention to understand
- Relate ideas to previous knowledge
- Look for patterns and underlying principles
- Check evidence and relate to conclusions
- Examine logic and argument critically
- Active engagement with content

**Surface Approach:**
- Intention to complete task requirements
- Memorize information for assessments
- Focus on discrete elements
- Accept information and ideas passively
- Concentrate on signs and formulas
- Unreflective association of concepts

**Key Insight:** These are not fixed traits but **contextually dependent approaches** influenced by teaching methods, assessment, and students' perceptions of requirements.

### Learning Study

**Definition:** A collaborative, theory-driven pedagogical design model developed in Hong Kong (2000-2003) based on variation theory.

**Process:**
1. Teachers identify object of learning
2. Analyze critical aspects through pre-assessment
3. Design lesson using variation patterns
4. Implement and observe
5. Post-assess student learning
6. Revise and reiterate

**Origins:**
- Developed by Marton and colleagues at University of Hong Kong (1999-2003)
- "Catering for Individual Differences – Building on Variation" (CID(v) Project)
- Publicly introduced November 27, 2001
- Adapted from Japanese Lesson Study with variation theory foundation

**Difference from Lesson Study:**
- **Japanese Lesson Study:** Focus on improving teaching practice through observation
- **Learning Study:** Theory-driven design based on variation theory, focus on object of learning
