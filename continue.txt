To the designer, but also to the executor, I want you to continue going. I am going to sleep, but commit what you have, note this commit to be the before sleep commit, and go on implementing features, make sure to follow TDD best practices. And keep on going. Implementing the next few phases. Don't add extra complexity. Add the minimum amount of features in order to have the user flow. The end user flow is what is important. Launch subagents to do work, but at the same time merge features back as early as possible, as long as they are tested. Also do end to end tests with @.orchestra/webtest.md
